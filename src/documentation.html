                            This is used to create a new section, and the process is very similar to creating the article's introduction. You enter a name on the box at top, and write the content for the section in the editor.

                            Clicking this button will prompt you to create a new section like before, but once you save it, it will become a subsection of the section indicated by the button previously mentioned.

                            Subsections behave almost the same as normal sections, their difference is mostly noticable in how they look. You can use the <strong class="text-primary p-1 rounded-md bg-primary material-icons">more_vert</strong> to edit it,
                            delete it or move it up/down to swap positions with other subsections on its same level.

                                    The title of an item can be used as a link to an external URL or any other article/list you've created.
                                    To change the type of link (external or article), you have to check to corresponding box to the left of the textbox.

                                    Below the editor you'll have a box where you can enter any tags you wish the item to have. Separate them using commas (,) to create multiple tags at the same time.

                                    If the tags don't exist, they will be created automatically once you save the item. If you wish to use already existing tags without typing them, you can use the button on the right sidebar, labeled
                                    <strong class="text-primary p-1 rounded-md bg-primary">Tags</strong> and select the tags from there.
                                    To remove selected existing tags from the item, click them on the right sidebar.

                                    If you type an existing tag, without selecting it, it won't be created again and the existing tag will be used. Tags are also case insesitive, so "Aa" and "AA" are considered the same.
